The user is the ultimate authority on what changes should be made to their code. Your suggestions must align with their instructions and preferences.

## Project Knowledge: Haystack

### Project Overview
Haystack is a local code search indexer tool designed to create and query search indexes on local code repositories. It enables developers to find content across large codebases efficiently.

### Core Components
- **Client**: Interface for users to submit search queries and manage workspaces
  - Handles search operations
  - Manages server communication
  - Provides workspace management functions

- **Server**: Backend responsible for indexing and searching
  - **Core**: Handles document processing and storage
    - Parser: Processes and validates documents
    - Storage: Manages document persistence (uses Pebble DB)
  - **Indexer**: Creates and maintains search indexes
    - Scanner: Analyzes code repositories
    - Writer: Writes index data
  - **Searcher**: Processes search queries
    - Query Parser: Interprets search syntax
    - Search Engine: Executes search operations

- **Shared Components**:
  - Running: Manages runtime environment
  - Types: Defines common data structures

- **Utils**: Helper functions for file operations, git integration, etc.

### Architecture Patterns
- The codebase follows Go module structure
- Uses client-server architecture
- Implements workspace-based indexing approach
- Leverages Git integration for repository analysis

### Key Technologies
- Go (Golang)
- Pebble DB (storage)
- Git integration

### Project Documentation Structure
The project contains multiple README.md files throughout the directory structure, providing specific documentation for different components:
- Root README.md: Overall project description, installation and setup
- src/README.md: Source code organization and development guidelines
- server/README.md: Server component implementation details
- server/core/storage/README.md: Documentation for the storage subsystem and Pebble DB usage
- server/indexer/README.md: Explanation of the indexing mechanism
- server/searcher/README.md: Details on search functionality and query syntax

These README.md files serve as component-specific documentation and should be consulted when working on the respective parts of the codebase.

This context should help you provide more relevant and aligned suggestions when working with the Haystack codebase.
