# You can copy this file to server.local.yaml and modify it to your own
# configuration for local development
# The server will automatically load the configuration from server.local.yaml
# if it exists.
# The server will try to load configuration files in the following order:
#  - $CWD/server.local.yaml
#  - $CWD/server.yaml
#  - $HOME/.search-indexer/server.yaml
#
# Copy the file to one of the above place.
